                <p>
                    I am interested in being a developer for your company.<br /><br /> I have been working at the
                    Exploratorium for 4 years now and I've worked many different departments which I feel helps me
                    understand many different facets of the museum.
                    I have worked with people of different age groups in different capacities, wether it be families
                    whilst a high school explainer, foreign tourists in the stores, school children on field trips,
                    businesspeople during rentals events,
                    and random visitors trying to buy tickets so I bring a perspective not many other people. I feel a
                    strength of mine lies in being flexible in my manner of presenting museum exhibits and
                    demonstrations.I always try to give new, relevant,
                    and unique information to represent exactly how the exploratorium helps you learn in unusual ways.
                    <br /><br /> I do not have professional experience as a developer but what I do have is 4 years of
                    self-taught skills compounded with formal education from General Assembly's Software Development
                    program. On top of that I have experience
                    building websites for for self-found clientele. I have taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
                    have learned how to use their frameworks such as Node, Jquery, React, and AJAX.
                    <br /><br /> I want to be a developer for your team so I can help with the mission while finding a
                    great professional outlet for my creative work.

            <h2 class="div-headers">About Eduardo</h2>
            <p>I was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico on February 27, 1997. At the age of five I moved to San
                Francisco, Ca with my parents to start a new life. One day I was playing video games and I wondered how
                the characters around environments in
                the games were responsive and it led me to learning how to program. Since that day I've been teaching my
                self HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. Other hobbies of mine include reading about history, learning about
                geography, writing in different
                genres, and doing stand up comedy in my spare time.</p>
